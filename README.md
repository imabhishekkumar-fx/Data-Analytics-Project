MIS Executive Sales Dashboard
As an MIS Executive, I have developed a comprehensive sales dashboard using Excel to efficiently monitor and analyze sales performance.

Hereâ€™s a brief description of the key components and functionalities:

Columns Included:

Emp Code: Unique identifier for each sales executive.

Region: The geographical area assigned to the sales executive.

Day1 - Day5: Daily sales figures for each day of the week.

Total Sales: Sum of sales from Day 1 to Day 5.

Target: The sales target assigned to each executive.

Target Hit %: Percentage of the target achieved.

Away From Target %: Percentage of the target yet to be achieved.

Dashboard Features:

Interactive Charts: Visual representation of total sales, target achievement, and regional performance.

Conditional Formatting: Highlights for quick identification of top performers and areas needing attention.

Filter Options: Easily filter data by region, sales executive, or date range.

Performance Summary: Automated summary providing insights into overall performance, target achievement rates, and variances.

Usage: The dashboard is designed to facilitate real-time decision-making by offering an intuitive and clear visualization of key sales metrics. It enables the management to:

Track daily sales progress.

Identify high-performing regions and sales executives.

Analyze sales trends over the week.

Make informed decisions to drive sales strategies and improve performance.

This project highlights my proficiency in using Excel for data analysis and reporting, ensuring that all stakeholders have access to accurate and actionable insights to achieve business objectives.
